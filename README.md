# Javascript Objects

An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. In this tutorial I will guide you how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.
